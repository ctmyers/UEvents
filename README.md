# UEvents
This project is an interactive Android prototype of UEvents, an app that connects college students on campus. There are 4 types of events our app supports: sports gatherings, study groups, social events, and club meetings. Users have the ability to browse for events, search for events, or create their own events.

## Browse/View an Event
Users can browse for events using either the Map View or the List View. The Map View uses Google Maps API to portray events happening nearby. The List View uses a list to portray events happening at that time. 

## Search for Events
Users can search for events by either filtering by the type of event or by typing in a keyword. They can also combine these two types of searches to ultimately make a more refined search.

## Create an Event
Users can also create their own events. Through the creation process, they need to input the title, description, time, location, category of event, and max number of people allowed to attend. Once published, any other user can view and join the event.

# How to run
1. Clone repository onto personal machine
2. Open project in android studio
3. Build app using gradel
4. Run on device or emulator

# How to use
* Use the map to locate events around you, or use the list to find events happening now
* Hit 'going' to mark that you're going to the event
* Hit 'cancel' to mark that you decided not to go to an event
* Hit the floating action button at any time to create an event
* Use the side menu to see which events you've created or that you're attending
